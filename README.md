# HomeManager

HomeManager is a simple solution for in-home ip cameras management. It allows to control devices with special politics and stream videos from cameras (rtsp) to web (hls).

HomeManager is designed for personal usage at home's local network (i.e. without access from the internet) with Mikrotik router and Xiaomi Xiaofang 1S cameras. You have to flash [custom firmware](https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks) for using cameras with HomeManager. 

This solution is not suitable for using in the production and may have some security weaknesses (for example, token-based auth mechanism doesn't support tokens renew process).
